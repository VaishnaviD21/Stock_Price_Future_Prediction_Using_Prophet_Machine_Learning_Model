**Tesla Stock Price Forecasting**

**Description**

I created this project to forecast the price of Tesla stock 30 days into the future using the Facebook Prophet machine learning model. Throughout the project, I learned to import libraries and datasets, create the model, and evaluate its performance by comparing the forecasted data with actual data. Additionally, I extracted financial data using Google Finance in Google Sheets and automated the entire forecasting process.
